# Tlibs (Tajamsoft Libs)

Tlibs are free to use (Public Domain) C/C++ libraries. 
They consist of only one .h file (maybe some will require also a .c file)


They are designed with being quick and easy to use in mind, and are as easy to 
use as including them onto your program.


Each library comes with a .md file documenting it and showing example usage
