# Tlibs (Tajamsoft Libs)

Tlibs are free to use (Public Domain) C/C++ libraries. 
They consist of only one .h file and one .c file.


They are designed with being quick and easy to use in mind, and are as easy to 
use as including them onto your program.


# List:

 - TinyTerm: A lightweight software rendered RGB terminal (tinyterm.h and tinyterm.c)
 
# License:
   
You can see the license of any of the libraries by checking the .h file, at the header there should
be a license specified.

If none is specified assume Open Domain license.
 


# FAQ:

#### Why are they not just a .h file?
This is done in order to make them easier to include. No need to have "#define IMPLEMENT_TINY_TERM" and such anywhere in your code, just include the .h file and you are good to go
