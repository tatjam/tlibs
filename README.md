# Tlibs (Tiny Libs)

Tlibs are free to use (Public Domain) C/C++ libraries. 
They consist of only one .h file (maybe some will require also a .c file)


They are designed with being quick and easy to use in mind, and are as easy to 
use as including them onto your program.


Each library comes with a .md file documenting it and showing example usage

# List:

 - [TinyTerm](https://github.com/tatjam/tlibs/blob/master/tinyterm.md): A lightweight software rendered RGB terminal (tinyterm.h)
 - [TinyGL](https://github.com/tatjam/NOT_YET_UPLOADED): Create and manage windows/GL context really easy and fast. Similar to GLFW
 
# License:
   
You can see the license of any of the libraries by checking the .h file, at the header there should
be a license specified.

If none is specified assume Open Domain license.
